Lab 2 - The Correct Way
Server 1 has a static IP address of 172.72.1.2
Server 2 has a static IP address of 172.72.2.3
S1 got first promoted to Domain Controller
Error: DHCP stopped working - I granted access to it.
DHCP -> Server -> Action -> Authorize

Client 2 (172.72.2.222) and Client 1 (172.72.1.111) have joined S1

Joining the domain requires either having an user account already created inside the domain for me, or using administrator credentials to log in.

Creating a new account for the domain through "Add an account" on the client does not work. I created a new account for my first connected client, named 2 (with the same password as everyone else)

C:\folder -> Properties -> Sharing -> Advanced Sharing -> Permissions -> UserTwo -> RW
C:\folder -> Properties -> Permissions -> Edit -> UserTwo -> RW
+ Inheritance internal file

By default, network sharing is turned of on the client and needs administrative rights to be turned on.

AD Sites and Services -> New Site
Subnets -> New Subnet (MainOffice = 172.72.1.0/24 / BranchOffice = 172.72.2.0/24)


S2 cannot join S1's Domain, due to its DNS being attached to S2, and S2 referring to itself.

I temporarily changed S2's primary DNS source to S1 and flushed its ipconfig cache settings in order to contact my AD Domain.

S2 has now joined the same domain.
When C2 authenticates, S2 (in the same subnet mask) will manage the request.
echo %logonserver% // from C2, S2 should appear as a result


AD Users and Groups -> domain -> Right-click -> New -> Organizational Unit
I created two users for each inner OU.
Remote Dev is managed by ITG (software on any ITG user will prove it)
I forgot to add that I re-made the subnet mappings on the AD Site tab, and replicated them through Server 1. I also found a fix modifying a string in

HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Netlogon\Parameters
